        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          After spending more than eight years living abroad and teaching
          English, I decided to embark on a new adventure and learn computer
          coding. I completed a coding bootcamp with a focus on the MERN stack.
          I’m eager to apply my experience and skills in new ways.

          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p>
            I've used my new skills in HTML and CSS to make this website. I've
            always been fond of design and the affects it can have on people.
            I’m excited to continue building my knowledge and the challenges
            that come with solving complex problems.

          <h3>Problem Solver</h3>
          <p>
            Years of working as an educator taught me how to solve problems in a
            fast-pace environment where having strong classroom management
            skills was a vital part of my success. I have creative
            problem-solving skills as well as the ability to build strong
            relationships with clients. My interpersonal skills, cultural
            awareness, and collaborative mindset are just some of the skills
            that drive my success.
